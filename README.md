angular-ui builder
==================

### Development

* Install node dependencies with `npm install`
* Install angular-ui submodule with `git submodule update --init`
* Run the server with `node server` and open a browser to `localhost:3000`
* Tip: if you're developing the server, install `node-dev` with `[sudo] npm install -g node-dev` and use `node-dev server` to run it, and it will reset the server each change
